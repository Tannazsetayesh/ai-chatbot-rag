It explains what needs to be done, how to do it, and who is responsible, ensuring consistent work performance. The IRM is used daily by IRS employees, managers, and executives. It is also used by the GAO, Chief Counsel, Taxpayer Advocate Service, and TIGTA to ensure the IRS operates effectively, efficiently, and provides quality service, complies with laws, and reduces risk. The public can also view the IRM to learn about IRS policies and procedures. The IRM is the official source of IRS procedures, policies, directives, delegations, and guidelines. It is the foundation for fulfilling legal obligations set forth in 5 USC 552(a)(2)(c), 44 USC 3101 and 36 CFR 1222 and is an essential component for tax administration and enterprise risk management.\n",
