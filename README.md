# Anika IRS AI Chatbot

This project demonstrates the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot capable of answering questions using authoritative IRS Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) documents. The notebook implements the full RAG pipelineâ€”from data collection and preprocessing to embedding, indexing, and large language model (LLM)-based response generation.

## Project Objectives

- Acquire unstructured HTML content from the IRS website
- Clean, parse, and intelligently chunk text data
- Embed and index content for semantic search
- Build a conversational AI assistant that retrieves relevant context and generates accurate answers with inline citations
- Deploy and interact with the system in a Google Colab notebook environment

## Key Features

- Crawler to download HTML documents (IRS IRM)
- HTML parsing using BeautifulSoup
- Intelligent text chunking using sentence boundaries
- Embedding generation using Vertex AI or other models
- Pinecone integration for vector search
- LLM-based query answering via Gemini or text-bison
- Interactive UI using ipywidgets

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Download HTML files from `https://www.irs.gov/irm/part1`
   - Store files in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Parse HTML and extract clean text
   - Chunk documents by sentence or heading while preserving context
   - Enrich with metadata (e.g., title, chunk index, source)

3. **Embedding and Indexing**
   - Use Vertex AI or any supported embedding model to convert chunks into vectors
   - Index chunks into Pinecone with metadata for retrieval

4. **Query Processing**
   - Embed user query
   - Retrieve top-k relevant chunks from Pinecone
   - Feed chunks and query into an LLLM for grounded response generation

5. **Interface**
   - Use ipywidgets in Google Colab to build a simple UI
   - Display real-time query responses directly in notebook

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Cloud Storage
- Vertex AI (Gemini, text-bison)
- Pinecone Vector Database
- BeautifulSoup
- LangChain
- ipywidgets
- tqdm

## Setup Instructions

1. **Environment**
   - Run the notebook in Google Colab (recommended)
   - Install dependencies

2. **Google Cloud**
   - Enable Vertex AI and Storage APIs
   - Set up a GCS bucket for storing downloaded HTML
   - Use the Vertex AI Python SDK for model access and embedding

3. **Pinecone**
   - Set up a Pinecone project
   - Create an index and note the environment and API key

4. **Notebook Execution**
   - Download HTML files
   - Parse and chunk documents
   - Generate embeddings and upsert to Pinecone
   - Ask queries using the RAG chatbot interface

## Testing

The notebook includes a test suite of IRS-specific queries to validate:
- Embedding quality
- Retrieval accuracy
- LLM response quality

These tests ensure that the chatbot can correctly find and cite relevant context from the indexed IRS documentation.

## Limitations

- Only public documents are supported
- Gemini model must be accessed through supported Vertex AI APIs
